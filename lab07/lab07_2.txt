Exercise 7.2:
a) Categorical data is data that is textual. Numerical data on the other hand is data that deals with numbers, and is
specifically data you want to treat as a number. Categorical data can be numbers as well, but in that case it's not
numbers that you'd want to do numerical operations with (ex. Zip Codes).

b) Task 1:
    train_model( learning_rate=0.0001, steps=100, batch_size=1000)
    This gave me a RSME of 166.39

   Task 2:
   train_model(
    learning_rate=0.0003,
    steps=800,
    batch_size=10,
    input_feature='population'
    )
    This gave me a RSME of 180.09. I had a hard time getting below 180.

c) Shuffling data allows it to be passed to a model randomly during training, which is important for making the model
generalized.
