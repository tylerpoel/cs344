Exercise 7.1:
a) Solutions to pandas exercises 1 & 2:
Exercise 1 solution:
cities["Big and saint"] = (cities['City name'].apply(lambda name: 'San' in name)) & (cities['Area square miles'] > 50)

Exercise 2 solution:
cities.reindex([20, 100, 5]) returns a tables with all NaN values, showing rows with missing values. Adding new rows
like this with missing values is good because it allows for easy merging with other data sets.

b) Pandas just seems like it has a lot more breadth of what it can do in terms of data manipulation. Helpful tools
like reading in CSV files into data frames, and easily creating new columns for those data frames are features that
are easy to use but also very powerful.

c) Reordering is a great way to shuffle/randomize a data frame. This could be very helpful for creating good
training/testing data sets.
