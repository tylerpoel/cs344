Exercise 9.3:

I did all of the suggested further experiments. Nothing had a significant effect. Changing the number of hidden units
from 16 to 8 bumped up the accuracy slightly to 88, but otherwise all the other changes were right around 88, which
is where the original architecture came in. I think to make any significant improvements on this architecture a lot
more nuanced or dramatic methods than changing features slightly would have to be implemented.
