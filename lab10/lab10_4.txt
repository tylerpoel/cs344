Exercise 10.4:

a.
i.
Both data sets contain 1000 images, with each image being 150x150 pixels.

ii.
The CNN presented here is similar to the one we did in class. Both have 3 convolutional layers with relu activation
functions. However in class we used 32, 32, and 64 filters respectively for our 3 layers, but in this example they use
16, 32, and finally 64 for their 3 layers. Both our class CNN and this example CNN flatten the image before output.

iii.
As the image is processed more and more a lot of distinguishing features are lost. There are much less clear images
of the animal. This is to be expected though.

The max-pooling step still does a good job of sending along the relevant information, which is a bit surprising, as it
simply sends the highest value.
