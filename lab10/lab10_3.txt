Exercise 10.3:

a.
It shows which classes were misclassified as other classes. In this specific example, it shows which numbers were
incorrectly labeled as different numbers. The given confusion matrix after Task 1 is actually pretty good,
with sometimes 4's getting classified as 9's, and 5's getting classified as 3's. However these don't happen extremely
frequently, as the accuracy was 0.90.

b.
The TensorFlow architect is pretty different from Keras. With tensor flow we have to provide arguments to the
function to build the model: how many hidden layers do we want, what're feature columns, etc. With Keras we simply
created a model, and then added layers as we pleased. It seemed a lot more simple. With TensorFlow we also always
have to provide input functions that contain the data, but with Keras we just give it the data as is.

I got an accuracy of 0.91 on the test set.

c.
There's a big difference between the visualization at 10 steps and 1000 steps. At 10 steps the visualizations are all
just super grainy, with really now distinguishing features between them. There's no information to be gleamed from them.
However with 1000 steps one can start to make out different shapes between the visualizations. It's still not
crystal clear, however there are clear differences and beginnings of shapes across the visualizations, as opposed to
constant grain at 10 steps.
