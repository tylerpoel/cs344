Exercise 10.1:

a. I would rather use Keras than TensorFlow. The Keras syntax and set-up is just a lot simpler and easy to understand
in my opinion. TensorFlow seems like it has so much going on, with a lot of different things the programmer has to do,
while Keras can do the same problem much more simply.

b.
Task 1 & 2:
With  learning_rate=0.001, steps=2000, batch_size=110, and hidden_units=[10, 10] I got a RMSE of 105.03 on the
final test data.
