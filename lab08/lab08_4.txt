Exercise 8.4

a.
With a small dataset, creating a validation set isn't practical, as it wold be very small. K-folds allows us to still
create a validation set out of our training set, by separating the training set into 4 or 5 partitions, creating the
same number of models, and then training each model on K-1 partitions, and evaluating on the remaining one. The
validation score is the average of all the models.

b.
If the values have wildly different ranges the model will incorrectly consider some features to be more important than
others.

c.
This makes intuitive sense to me. A smaller dataset may have less feature, or simply less data, and so a simpler
network will be better suited for this, rather than a large and complicated one that might be a little bit overkill,
and will possibly over-fit.

d.
Changing the architecture didn't improve the model. Subtracting layers didn't help, as it stunted the power of the
network, while adding layers starts to over-fit. The same philosophy holds for making the layers wider or narrower.
