Exercise 8.2

a.
The Pearson correlation coefficient measures correlation. In this example correlation is between a feature and its
target, and a feature compared to other features.

In this example, the correlation between median_income and the target had a correlation of 0.7. This makes sense to me,
as income level seems like a good indicator of the value of the house that person would/can buy.

b.
Task 1:
I chose "median_income", "rooms_per_person", and "longitude" to be my features.

With:
learning_rate=0.001, steps=600, batch_size=5, I got a RMSE of 115.13.

Task 2:
For my synthetic feature I did a bin for each latitude range (32-33, 33-34, etc.)
Using a learning_rate=0.05, steps=400, and batch_size=2, my final RMSE was 84.37. This beats the google provided
baseline.
