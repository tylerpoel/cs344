Exercise 8.3

a.
FTRL scales the learning rate differently for different coefficients, depending on what will work best for each
particular coefficient.

b.
The current API for feature columns only supports discrete features for crosses. Therefore buckets can be used to
cross continuous features.

c.
Task 1:
bucketized_latitude = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
  latitude, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
  training_examples["latitude"], 10))

bucketized_housing_median_age = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
  housing_median_age, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
  training_examples["housing_median_age"], 10))

bucketized_median_income = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
  median_income, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
  training_examples["median_income"], 10))

bucketized_rooms_per_person = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
  rooms_per_person, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
  training_examples["rooms_per_person"], 10))

With a learning_rate=1.0, steps=500, and batch_size=100, the RMSE was 89.01.
It didn't make much sense to me as to why we bucketized all the features we did in this Task. We've used these
features before normally, and haven't had any issues with it. The process of bucketizing does make sense though.

Task 2:
long_x_lat = tf.feature_column.crossed_column([bucketized_latitude, bucketized_longitude], 1000)
With a learning_rate=1.0, steps=500, and batch_size=100, the RMSE was 79.6.
A unique cross could be crossing households and median_income. This could be useful as it can show the density of
people with certain incomes at specific areas.
