Project Proposal - draft:

I'm interested in exploring text generation using neural networks, specifically a LSTM. I would feed the
network in a large text file, and based off of how I train it I'm interested in what type of text generation I'd
receive. I'll be referencing and adapting from the Chollet work book on github, specifically
8.1-text-generation-with-lstm.ipynb.

In this example the text fed into the network are the writings of a German philosopher. I'd like to adapt this
model to feed it in the script for one of my favorite movies: Star Wars. Currently there are two different types
of scripts I'm considering using: one that contains simply just the dialogue and the names of the characters that say
the specific line, and the other being one that contains both the dialogue and paragraphs that introduce the scene,
describe the setting, etc. Training on either of these scripts could yield different and interesting results.
