a.  i. P(User)
        = P(User = true) = 0.089
        and P(User = false) = 1 - 0.089 = 0.91
        => P(User) = <0.089, 0.91>
    ii. P(test | user) = 0.99
    iii. P(¬test | user) = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01
    iv.  P(test | ¬user)
          = 1 - P(¬test | ¬user)
          = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02
    v. P(User | test)
