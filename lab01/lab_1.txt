Exercise 1.1:
b.
1. GPS is implemented as a function.
2. The initial states, goal states, and operators are of the list types.
3. It is recursive. The main GPS function calls on another function (the achieve_all function),
    which itself calls on another function, and so forth.

d.
1. monkeys.py models the famous monkey and banana problem. The rules are defined with certain
    constraints for the monkey: it knows how to move, carry things, reach for the bananas, and wave a stick
    around in the air. I think the code has a pretty faithful implementation of the problem. It gives the intial,
    goal, and possible actions clearly, and these states seem to reflect the original problem accurately.
2.
3. The GPS first looks for the given goal state within the "add-list" for given actions. If it can find the goal
    state it tries to then achieve all the preconditions for that given action by looking through the "add-list"
    of other operations to achieve those preconditions. If it can't achieve all of them it moves onto a different
    action with the add-list goal state. If in the end it can't find any ways to achieve the goal state it
    reports that fact.
