Exercise 11.1:

a. Task 1:
I think in some instances a linear model is preferable. Perhaps if the problem is very obviously linear, and a neural
network would seem like overkill, the linear model would be good to use. Linear models are also much quicker to train,
which can be very useful in some circumstances.

b. Task 2:
The neural network does better than the linear model, but not by a significant amount. The NN gets 0.8 accuracy
on the training data compared to the linear models 0.78 accuracy. These improvements are similar for the test data.

c. Task 3:
The embeddings don't seem to offer much of an improvement, as the accuracy on the training data was 0.79.

d. Tasks 4-5:
A lot of negative words are in the region in the bottom left. Specifically, the two words "unfortunately" and
"disappointing" are right on top of each other. This makes sense, as they carry very similar connotations.

e. Task 6:
In my feature column I used all 30,716 terms from the vocabulary file. I also changed the hidden_units argument to
[20, 20]. Finally, I trained the model using 3,000 steps. In the end my best performance was 87% accuracy on the
training data, with 84% accuracy on the test data.
