Exercise 11.2:

a. Task #1:
    capital_gain and capital_loss both have almost all values of zero. This seems odd. A lot of the data also
    seems to be right-skewed, such as workclass, marital_status, occupation, and race. Perhaps this is expected,
    however there's also a strong difference between the number of males and females. The number of males is
    almost double that of females, when we'd expect them to be around the same.

b. Task #2:
    I binned race, with the color being income_bracket. While white is the race represented the most in the dataset,
    the proportions of other races between <50k and >50k were all mostly similar. White however looks like it has
    a slightly higher proportion of people with an income of >50k.

d. Task #4:
    The accuracy and AUC for the black subcategory is relatively high, however the recall
    for the Black subcategory is really poor compared to the other subcategories. In the Black subcategory there are
    more false negatives than true positives, meaning that our model isn't doing a good job of recognizing an income
    level <50k. However this seems to be only for the Black subcategory. Perhaps our model has biases or is skewed
    against the Black subcategory.
