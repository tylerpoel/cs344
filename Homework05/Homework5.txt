Exercise 1:
Answering question 7.2 from the book.

Rules:
mythical -> immortal
not mythical -> mortal mammal
immortal -> horned
mammal -> horned
horned -> magical

Is the unicorn mythical?
    There's no way to prove the unicorn is mythical. To be mythical it must be immortal, or to be not mythical
    it must be a mortal mammal, however there's no way to prove if the unicorn is immortal or mortal, leaving
    the question unable to be answered.

Is the unicorn magical?
    Yes, the unicorn is magical, because it's horned. A rule explicitly gives this.

Is the unicorn horned?
    The unicorn is definitely horned. A unicorn can be either an immortal creature, or a mortal mammal.
    Whether or not it's immortal or a mammal, it will have horns. Therefore the unicorn must be horned, as
    the rules don't allow for a different possibility.


I don't think this would be too hard to implement in Prolog. The rules don't seem too complex, and I think
could easily be implemented in Prolog's syntax.
